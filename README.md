# Predicting-DIABETES
# Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. It has become a significant public health concern worldwide, with its prevalence steadily increasing in recent years. The ability to predict the onset of diabetes in individuals can aid in early intervention and prevention strategies, thereby reducing the risk of complications associated with the disease. In this paper, we aim to explore the predictive capabilities of various machine learning models in determining the likelihood of diabetes onset based on diagnostic measures.
# The dataset used in this study is derived from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, originating from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It comprises several medical predictor variables and one target variable, "Outcome," indicating whether a patient has diabetes or not. The predictor variables include the number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. The dataset's subjects are females aged at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Objective
# The primary objective of this study is to develop predictive models capable of identifying individuals at risk of diabetes onset based on their diagnostic measures. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to evaluate the performance of different algorithms in classifying individuals into diabetic and non-diabetic categories.
